# IntroLikelihoodToBayes

This repo includes slides and R scripts used on the 1st day of the course "Introduction to Likelihood and Bayes", held by Manuele Bazzichetto and Petr Keil at the Department of Spatial Sciences of the Czech University of Life Sciences.

The material covers topics that range from data to parametric models for statistical populations (DataModels presentation), and from basic principles of probability and maximum likelihood estimation to Bayes' rule and Bayesian estimation of model parameters (ProbabilityLikelihoodBayes).

Slides are provided as html and .qmd files. This will allow people to modify, correct, integrate any material presented during the course. 

For most of the R examples (e.g., LikelihoodEstimation.R), I used the (amazing) palmerpenguins dataset[^1], which is made available through a namesake R package.

For any doubt or inquiry, please contact me at: manuele.bazzichetto@gmail.com
